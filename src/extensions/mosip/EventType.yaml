  Standardized codes/values represent key events to [integrate](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/integrations/mosip-opencrvs-integration#scope) with civil registries. <br><br>
  **Sample flow to explain birth registration between MOSIP and CRVS systems:**
  1. Step 1: MOSIP subscribes to BIRTH_REGISTERED event with CRVS for RegistrationRecord
  2. Step 2: CRVS subscribes to BIRTH_REGISTERED event with MOSIP for MOSIPVerifiableCredential
  3. Step 3: CRVS notifies RegistrationRecord data to MOSIP 
  4. Step 4: MOSIP notifies MOSIPVerifiableCredential data to CRVS <br>

  **Sample flow to explain data modification (push) flow from MOSIP to CRVS systems:**
    1. Step 1: CRVS subscribes to DATA_MODIFICATION event with MOSIP for MOSIPToken data
    2. Step 2: MOSIP notifies MOSIPToken data to CRVS<br>

  **Note:** 
  1. Data modifiation (pull) flow can be accomodated with sync/search or existing mosip's eKyc auth api.
  2. Death, Death Reversal fllows same pattern as described in for birth registration.

enum:
  - "BIRTH_REGISTERED"
  - "DEATH_REGISTERED"
