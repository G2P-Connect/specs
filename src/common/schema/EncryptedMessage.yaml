  ciphertext:
    type: string
    description: This is the result of encrypting the plaintext using the CEK and the IV. It's Base64Url-encoded.
  encrypted_key:
    type: string
    description: The base64-url encoded encrypted key
  tag:
    type: string
    description: This is a Base64Url-encoded value that provides evidence of the integrity and authenticity of the ciphertext, Initialization Vector, and Additional Authenticated Data
  iv:
    type: string
    description:  This is a Base64Url-encoded random bit string to be used as the Initialization Vector (IV) when encrypting the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. The size of the IV depends on the encryption algorithm used.
