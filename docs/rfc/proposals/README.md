# Proposals

These documents contain all proposals submitted by the community to be included in G2P Connect specifications. The community is encouraged to submit as many proposals as possible to ensure a robust and interoperable protocol. 

After sufficient discussions, these documents may be selected for further review by the working groups as Specs Drafts.
